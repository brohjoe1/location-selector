jQuery based cascading dropdown list for schools

This is a non-Angular jquery based solution. It provides a country, state and schools cascading dependent dropdown list written in jQuery.
This list is based on the 2018-2019 FedSchoolCodeList.  It contains dropdown data for North America only.  The data is pulled from a 
database api.
